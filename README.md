# Speech Emotion Recognition

This repository contains code and resources for a [**Speech Emotion Recognition**](https://github.com/notEasyBeingAnushka/Speech-Emotion-Recognition-WiDS-2024) project. The goal is to classify emotions in speech data using machine learning techniques.

## Week 1: Python Basics
In **Week 1**, the focus was on foundational Python libraries:
- [**NumPy**](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/index.html): Array manipulation for scientific computing.
- [**Librosa**](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html): Music and audio analysis.
- [**Pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/): Data manipulation using DataFrames.
- [**Matplotlib**](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html): Visualization and plotting.

## Week 2: Two-Body Problem Simulation
In **Week 2**, we applied the libraries learned in Week 1 to build a **Logistical Regression Model** and a **Support Vector Machine** from scratch:
- [**Logistical Regression**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementation-of-logistic-regression-from-scratch-using-python/): Implementing logistical regression algorithm on the breast cancer dataset from **scikit-learn**.
- [**Support Vector Machine**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/support-vector-machine-algorithm/): Building a SVM, trainining it on custom data and plotting the results.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/notEasyBeingAnushka/Speech-Emotion-Recognition-WiDS-2024.git
2. **Run the Notebooks**:
   - Navigate to the appropriate week folder (e.g., `Week_1` or `Week_2`).
   - Open the `.ipynb` files using a Jupyter Notebook environment or Google Colab:
     - For Jupyter Notebook, run:
       ```bash
       jupyter notebook
       ```
     - Or, upload the notebook to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
